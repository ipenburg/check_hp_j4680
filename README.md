# DEPENDENCIES

Perl 5.16.0, Monitoring::Plugin, HTTP::Tiny, List::MoreUtils, Readonly, English

# EXIT STATUS

The exist status is handled by the monitoring interface.

# CONFIGURATION

The default warning and critical thresholds should be overridden by the
standard -w and -c options of the monitoring interface because they depend on
the usage of the device. The defaults thresholds are:

- black 10: 1:
- color 10: 1:
- pages 9000 10000
- signal 4: 1:

# INCOMPATIBILITIES

There are no known incompatibilities but since the data is scraped from pages
in an undefined format, different firmware version could present the data in a
different format which might break things. It is compatible with Firmware
Version `YWM2FN0820BR`.

# BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

The 'ready' function only determines between 'Ready' and not.
